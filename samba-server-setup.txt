Step 1: Install Samba in Linux
------------------------------
command : 
	sudo apt install samba samba-common samba-client


Step 2: Create and Configure Samba Shares
-----------------------------------------
command : 
	sudo mkdir /share-data
	sudo chown -R  nobody:nobody /share-data

=> Next, we are going to make some configurations in the smb.conf configuration file which is Sambaâ€™s main configuration file. But before we do so, we will back up the file by renaming it with a different file extension.
command :
	sudo mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak

=> Next, we are going to create a new configuration file.
command : 
	sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf

smb.conf file 
-------------
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Samba Server %v
netbios name = rocky-8
security = user
map to guest = bad user
dns proxy = no
ntlm auth = true



[Public]
path =  /share-data
browsable =yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes


=> To verify the configurations made, run the command:
command : sudo testparm


=> Next, start and enable Samba daemons as shown.
command : 
	sudo systemctl start smb
	sudo systemctl enable smb
	sudo systemctl start nmb
	sudo systemctl enable nmb

=> Be sure to confirm that both the smb and nmb daemons are running.
command : 
	sudo systemctl status smb
	sudo systemctl status nmb


=> Currently, our directory is empty as we have not created any files. So, we will head back to our terminal and create a few files in the samba share directory.

command : 
	cd /srv/tecmint/data
	sudo touch file{1..3}.txt

Step 3: Secure Samba Share Directory
------------------------------------
=> First, we will create a new samba user.
command : 
	sudo useradd smbuser

=> Next, we will configure a password for the samba user. This is the password that will be used during authentication.
command : 
	sudo smbpasswd -a smbuser

=> Next, we will create a new group for our secure samba share and add the new samba user.
command : 
	sudo groupadd smb_group
	sudo usermod -g smb_group smbuser

=> Thereafter, create yet another samba share which will be securely accessed. In our case, we have created another directory in the same path as the

command : 
	sudo mkdir -p  /private

=> Then configure the file permissions for the samba share
command : 
	sudo chmod -R 770 /private
	sudo chown -R root:smb_group /private

=> Once again, access the Samba configuration file.
command : 
	sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf

=> Add these lines to define to secure samba share in smb.conf
[Private]
path = /srv/tecmint/private
valid users = @smb_group
guest ok = no
writable = no
browsable = yes

=> Finally, restart all the samba daemons as shown.
command : 
	sudo systemctl restart smb
	sudo systemctl restart nmb

Step 4: Accessing Samba Share from Linux Client
-----------------------------------------------
command :
	smbclient //192.168.29.203/Private -U smbuser%smbuser

step 5:now do test connection in UI
-----------------------------------
